# Task Management Application with Authentication and Drag & Drop Functionality.

# This is a full-stack Task Management Application built with React, TanStack Query, and React-Beautiful-DnD on the frontend and a Node.js backend. It features user authentication (register, login, logout) and allows users to create, view, and manage tasks with a drag-and-drop interface.


üöÄ Features
User Authentication:
Users can register, log in, and log out securely using JWT.

Task Management:
Create, view, and delete tasks seamlessly.

Drag & Drop:
Tasks can be reordered using a modern drag-and-drop interface provided by react-beautiful-dnd.

Optimized State Management:
Powered by TanStack Query, ensuring efficient data fetching and caching.

Responsive Design:
Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile users..

- npm install --prefix frontend
# Run the Application
- npm run start

üåü Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. Drag-and-Drop Integration
Problem: Ensuring tasks update their order in the database after being rearranged.
Solution: Used the onDragEnd handler from react-beautiful-dnd to capture new task order and update the backend.

2. Handling Authentication
Problem: Managing JWT tokens for secure API requests.
Solution: Implemented Axios interceptors to include the JWT token in every request.

3. State Management
Problem: Efficiently fetching and caching tasks for optimal performance.
Solution: Used TanStack Query to minimize redundant API calls and keep data synchronized.

4. CORS Issues
Problem: Cross-origin requests failing during local development.
Solution: Added CORS middleware in the backend:
js

- const cors = require("cors");
- app.use(cors());

  üèóÔ∏è Future Improvements
- Implement user profiles and avatars.
- Add task deadlines and notifications.
